## üìñ What I Learned

This project was a deep dive into modern JavaScript and browser APIs, covering:

1. **State Management**:
   - Managed account data using objects and updated the UI dynamically.

2. **DOM Manipulation**:
   - Used `querySelector`, `addEventListener`, and `insertAdjacentHTML` to build and update the UI.

3. **Date and Time APIs**:
   - Learned to calculate and format dates using `Intl.DateTimeFormat` and `Date` objects.

4. **Currency Formatting**:
   - Implemented `Intl.NumberFormat` for locale-specific currency display.

5. **Array Methods**:
   - Explored methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `forEach` for handling data.

6. **Timers and Intervals**:
   - Used `setTimeout` and `setInterval` for logout timers and animations.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Ensured secure and seamless transactions with validations and conditions.

8. **Code Optimization**:
   - Modularized functionality into reusable functions for clarity and maintainability.
